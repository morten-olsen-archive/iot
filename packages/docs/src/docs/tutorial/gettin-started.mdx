import { Devices} from '../components.ts';

# Getting started

So, before we start I will like to introduce you to the home we are going to be automating. It has a living room, a bath room, a kitchen and a bedroom with a number of iot devices within each of them.

Don't worry, we will start out small, and only focus on some individual devices, so you can get an understanding of how this project works, but just so you have an idea of what we are doing.
