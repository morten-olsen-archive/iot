# Combining units

Okay we have now tried to create two different units, but we want them to run at the same time; _time to introduce the concept of combining units._

So we will now focus on both our buttons, as well as our motion sensor

<Devices onlyBaseKeys={['motionSensors.0', 'dimmerSwitches.0']} />

And we are still controlling our "Light 1"

<Devices onlyBaseKeys={['lights.0']} />

So now we can use a special `Unit` called a multiplex, which allows us to combine multible different units into one single unit, by supplying them as an array to its constructor.

<Preview file="/tutorial/combinedUnits.ts" />

Now try to run the example above, and indeed both our buttons and our motion sensor is working at the same time

<WarpButton label="5 min" amount={5 * 60 * 1000} />

<Next title="Special units" to="./special-units.mdx" />
