# Introduction

`@morten-olsen/iot` is a code focused IOT platform. This makes it quite different from more userfriendly options like OpenHAB or Home Assistant, since everything has to be done through code.

The reason is that I personally ended up spending more time working around the user friendliness to try to solve issues which would have been trivial if I was writing the code.

This approach may not be for everyone so before spending time installing and setting up `@morten-olsen/iot` it may be worth looking at a few simple example of how it work so you can decide if this project is for you.

The first example I'll show is a Very simple one. This simply turns on the light and changes its hue to a random color every 3 seconds.
